# WhatsAI - Auto Blogger AI Agent

WhatsAI is a modular, multi-agent AI system that automates the end-to-end workflow of trending blog generation. It identifies trending topics, extracts relevant information from top-performing sources, and generates detailed, high-quality blog posts using large language models.

## Features

- **Trend Discovery:** Automatically scrapes Google Trends to identify popular and timely topics.
- **Content Aggregation:** Retrieves relevant information from multiple top-ranked websites using web crawling and custom scraping.
- **AI Blog Generation:** Crafts unique, structured blog posts in JSON format using Gemini APIs.

## System Architecture

The system is built using a **sequential multi-agent architecture**, where each agent performs a specific task and passes structured data to the next:

1. **Trend Finder** ‚Äì Extracts real-time trending topics from Google Trends.
2. **Content Finder** ‚Äì Searches the web for relevant articles and scrapes the content.
3. **Blog Writer** ‚Äì Uses Gemini LLMs to generate blog posts in structured JSON format.
